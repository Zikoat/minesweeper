##How to play?

You need to have node installed,

once that is installed run
node main.js [width] [height] [bombs]

*width is the width of the game board
*height is the height of the game board
*bombs is the amount of bombs that should be planted

for example:
node main.js 9 9 10

This would create a gameboard that is 9 tiles wide and 9 tiles high, and totally 10 bombs.
