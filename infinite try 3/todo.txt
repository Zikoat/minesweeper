we create a new pormise, and add the loader  things in the function. when done loading, do all the thens
we now use p.then whenever we need somithng run after it has loaded

we cans just load all the things, and run the code after we have loaded, have a function which is called after constructor

to do better code: 
var f is passed
tex is fieldrenderer.tex
var width is fieldrenderer.cellWidth
var app = fieldrenderer.app
class controls is clickhandler
	put dragging into clickhandler
	emits events when things are selected
	handle keyboard controls
	toggle keyboard/mouse selection
	on keyboard controls, move field slowly towards cursor
class textures
move the bot to its own file

promises didnt work. commit message: moved loader into a promise, renamed updateCell to windows.updateCell

is f.getcell called in updatecell? yes

problem: the field is created after the renderer has been initialized, should work fine

if field.enableView then updateCell()

fix menu click propagation

flagging: lone cells dont get flagged

use a grid library on the bottom of this minefield implementation
make the grid be able to use for of loop to loop through all cells
