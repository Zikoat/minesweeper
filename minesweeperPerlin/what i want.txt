oceans, boat to travel from island to island
get global points from conquering large islands
if you dont finish an island(continents can get large) all the non-water tiles you have opened will be marked as yours, with your color. these will earn you points. if you take all the land around lake, lake will be yours. 
you can only travel through land that is open.
